                                <p>"You simply won't find anyone better."</p>
                                <div class="full-text">
                                        <p>We have been using Alexxis well over a year now, to come trim our three dog's nails, as well as expressions for one that needs it regularly.</p>
                                                        <p>The first time she showed up, I knew I would like her, before she even got to my door! She is very polite, always on time, always has everything she needs with her, and most importantly she does a phenomenal job with all three of my dogs (two female Beagles and a male Yorkie). She talks with them, as she is trimming their nails in a very calming way. She even gives each of my dog's treats, when she is done! And we all know how much dogs love treats!</p>
                                                        <p>And knowing she is a Veterinary Assistant, gives me even more piece of mind.</p>
                                                        <p>My dogs love Alexxis! And my husband and I do too. She is very easy to schedule with, and when I e-mail her, I always hear back from her quickly.</p>
                                                        <p>I highly recommend Alexxis! You simply won't find anyone better.</p>

                                        <p>We needed a pet sitter for our two dogs and three cats while we were away on vacation in the middle of May and Alexxis was the perfect fit for our needs. She expertly cared for all our pets. All the pets were happy and well-cared for while my wife and I were away. We were so pleased with Alexxis' care that we are using her again for our next vacation in June!</p>

                                        <p>I feel 100% relaxed and confident with Alexxis as one of my dog's two main pet sitters. I love the fact that she is a trained veterinary assistant, who works with all types of animals in her everyday career. Not only is she sweet and caring with my precious dog, but she also knows how to work with him on behavior problems, and can detect when he may not be feeling well, or if there is something I need to get checked out. Alexxis is very reliable, and has been flexible and available - even in those last-minute situations where something comes up and I can't get home to let my dog out. I highly recommend her. Her experience and love for animals make her your #1 choice!</p>

                                        <p>Alexxis watched our 1 year old (very energetic) puppy overnight and I couldn't have been happier! She set up a "Meet and Greet" beforehand so we could see how my dog interacted with her and was in constant communication with us before and during our trip. She is so friendly and professional- we will definitely use her in the future!</p>

                                        <p>Alexxis just came to our house and trimmed both of our cats' nails for us. She is so sweet and extremely professional. She did great, fast work and the cats did great! I wanted someone to come to us since my cats really stress out in cars and taking them to the vet for a 5 minute nail trim is just a very long/stressful process for all of us. She brought all of her own tools and kitty treats :) I couldn't recommend her highly enough! I will definitely be calling her again, and am glad I found her!!</p>

                                        <p>We just got back from a four day trip and we used Alexxis as our pet sitter for our three labs. All three are large dogs and the oldest one has allergies, so we needed someone who was comfortable being around big/active dogs and someone who could administer medications, if needed. Alexxis came every morning for two hours and returned each evening for another two hours. She provided everything from playtime, to belly rubs and especially that extra attention that was needed in our absence. We also took her up on an optional nail trim for two of the labs, which was a real bonus! Each visit she provided us with detailed sheets of the services rendered, including what treats were given. We will definitely continue to use Alexxis to take care of our "children" in the future when we are away from home!</p>

I just know that this is so much better for them and, of course, therefore for me as well. I've had some bad experiences with dog sitters over the years and now I feel so thankful knowing that I could be away and not have to worry about my little ones. I very highly recommend Alexxis and Anthony!</p>
