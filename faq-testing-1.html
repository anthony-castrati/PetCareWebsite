      Initial consultation is free for all clients who pre-pay and book services with Capital City Pet Care before or during the consult. A $30 reservation fee will be due before the meet and greet with CCPC and that fee will be deducted from your first bill making the meet and greet free. If you decide to decline services at this time, you have 14 days to change your mind. We require at least a two day in advance booking for consultations. Please be aware that Capital City Pet Care is unable to provide services for aggressive or venomous pets. If we determine your pet is aggressive or venomous, we will be forced to decline services and the consultation fee will not be refunded. There will be a $20 fee for each additional 30 minutes beyond the allotted 1-hour time frame.

      An initial consultation allows us meet you and your pets to determine if we are the right fit for the job. It also allows us to discuss your pets needs and requirements, get an idea of where things are located and to discuss the service agreement. We will also collect keys, payment and a copy of each pet’s proof of rabies vaccination. These consultations generally last 15-30 minutes, but can go up to an hour depending on your pet’s needs.

      Follow-up consultations are $30 for up to 1-hour of time and there will be a $20 fee for each additional 30 minutes beyond the allotted 1-hour time frame. These consultations are required if you move to a new home, acquire a new pet, or any pet has a major change in medical needs.  We require this consultation to become acquainted with your new home or pet, obtain new keys, and have any necessary paperwork updated at this time.

The second key provides us access without having to interrupt your time away and guarantees we can get to your pets to care for them. Two keys are required for service. The main key is kept with us for providing services and the second key is kept locked in our office when not in use or may also be active with another sitter.

      Each visit can be tailored to your needs, but in general we first and foremost make sure each pet looks well and doesn’t require any medical attention. We make sure the pups get a potty break/walk/yard/house play, the kitties get play time and pets, provide fresh food and water, scoop litter boxes, administer medications, take the garbage cans out on trash day, rotate lights and blinds, check the mail, and make sure to keep everything like it was found.

      We think of each pet as having their own personality and quirks. Some pets do well in high energy environments, but some pets have general anxiety or dislike car rides. Some pets don’t eat well while in a high stress situation or develop gastrointestinal problems due to stress. Most pets are generally happier in their own environment and hiring a pet sitter makes this a reality. Less stress equals happier and healthier pets. Not only do you have peace of mind that your pets are comfortable at home you can also have peace of mind that your home is being looked after as well.

      Per our policy we require at least one visit per day for feline clients. It is due to many reasons we have this policy in effect. For example, a kitty that is blocked for more than 24 hours could result in permanent kidney damage or even death. Accidentally locking themselves up away from food and water, other sudden medical emergencies (unknown tumors, fecal blockages, foreign bodies, etc), getting themselves or a limb caught in something, etc. are just a few more reasons. There are so many scenarios that "could" happen and we've actually experienced all of these and caught them in time! So, we want to ensure we can act in a timely manner if something were to arise. We care about the well-being of your pets and want to provide the best service!

Please keep in mind even if we are able to reach your home during crisis, visit times may be altered to fit the circumstances. In the event that no emergency contact is provided with access to the home the owner understands that service will be provided as soon as it is possible.
