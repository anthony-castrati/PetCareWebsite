                            <p>Hello! My name is Alexxis Castrati, owner and operator of Capital City Pet Care of Raleigh and Knightdale. I have been providing care in the pet industry since 2003 and have found those moments to be the most precious to me. After working several years at a boarding kennel, a veterinary hospital, and pet sitting part-time I decided to open Capital City Pet Care so that I may offer a more personal and catered type of pet service. Our pets are like our children and we want nothing but the best for them. Home care is a special type of service that allows us to take care of your pets in their own environment while you are away from home. Less stress equals happier and healthier pets!</p>
                            <p>I graduated early from Mt. Olive College where I obtained my Bachelors of Science Degree in Biology. After Mt. Olive I took a semester at NCSU to study animal nutrition and anatomy. While in school I volunteered for several organizations to help out in the pet community. I was able to help shelter animals get adopted through <a href="http://www.pittfriends.com/" target="_blank">Pitt Friends</a>, rehabilitate local wildlife through the <a href="http://www.nczoo.org/animals/wildliferehabcenter.html" target="_blank">Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Asheboro Zoo</a> and help raise money for the many cats in need through the Marley Fund.</p>
