      		<blockquote>
			  <p>During your consultation we will familiarize ourselves with you and your home all while enabling your pet(s) to interact with us and approve of our company. We will take the time to answer any questions and formulate the right care plan for you and your pets. We will collect a completed new client information packet and recommend having keys ready at this time to avoid any key handling fees. Please expect this meeting to last anywhere from 30-45 minutes.</p>

      		<blockquote>
			  <p>Is your dog licking, scratching, scooting, or biting at its tail? Do you smell a funny odor? It may be time for an anal sac expression! Many factors can affect the anal sacs such as soft stools, allergies, and the quality of their food. Having a full sac can become uncomfortable, impacted, or infected.</p>
