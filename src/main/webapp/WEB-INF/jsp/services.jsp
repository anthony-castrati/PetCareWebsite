                      An initial consultation is required for all new clients. During your consultation we will familiarize ourselves with you and your home all while enabling your pet(s) to interact with us and determine if we are the right match for the job. We will take the time to answer any questions and formulate the right care plan for you and your pet(s). We will collect a completed new client information packet and recommend having keys ready at this time to avoid any key handling fees. Please expect this meeting to last anywhere from 30-60 minutes.

                      Most of us work long hours and are always on the go. There comes a moment when we realize that we are not able to give our pets all the attention they desire, or provide that extra walk or potty break they need. Mental and physical well being are key to the overall health and wellness of our pets and that's where Capital City Pet Care can help! Midday walks are a great way to provide that extra mental and physical stimulation that our pets need throughout the day. We would love to provide that added love and attention while you are away. Midday walks are M-F typically from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

                      Is your dog licking, scratching, scooting, or biting at its tail? Do you smell a funny odor? It may be time for an anal sac expression! Many factors can affect the anal sacs such as soft stools, allergies, and the quality of their food. Having a full sac can become uncomfortable, impacted, or infected.

                      Expression prices are applicable for expressions where the owner is able to hold/restrain the pet(s). When scheduling an expression, please inform us if you are unable to restrain your pet or would like an additional member of Capital City Pet Care to help with restraint. An additional <strong>$10</strong> per household will be charged in this event.
