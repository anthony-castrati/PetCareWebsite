                            <p>Hello! My name is Alexxis Castrati, owner and operator of Capital City Pet Care of Raleigh and Knightdale. I have been providing care in the pet industry since 2003 and have found those moments to be the most precious to me. After working several years at a boarding kennel, a veterinary hospital, and pet sitting part-time I decided to open Capital City Pet Care so that I may offer a more personal and catered type of pet service. Our pets are like our children and we want nothing but the best for them. Home care is a special type of service that allows us to take care of your pets in their own environment while you are away from home. Less stress equals happier and healthier pets!</p>
                            <p>I graduated early from Mt. Olive College where I obtained my Bachelors of Science Degree in Biology. After Mt. Olive I took a semester at NCSU to study animal nutrition and anatomy. While in school I volunteered for several organizations to help out in the pet community. I was able to help shelter animals get adopted through <a href="http://www.pittfriends.com/" target="_blank">Pitt Friends</a>, rehabilitate local wildlife through the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of <a href="http://www.nczoo.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Asheboro Zoo</a> and help raise money for the many cats in need through the Marley Fund.</p>

                            <p>My husband, Anthony, a North Carolina State University graduate also helps with pet sitting visits and website maintenance.</p>
                            <p>My husband and I are the proud parents of one goofy lab mix, Apollo, three quirky cats, Pandora, Penelope, and Midge, one fearless chinchilla, Yoshimoto and one crested gecko, Kakarot. They truly bring happiness to our everyday!</p>
